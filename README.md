*Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app's goals and requirements were meant for users to track their weight as they progress towards their goal weight.



*What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

This app needed a main screen that displayed their weight in a chart after daily weigh-ins. I had to be mindful of this simple fact in order to keep on track and make the design as user-centered as possible.



*How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the coding by taking a modular approach, which is easier to modify and correct as I progressed. I plan to apply this same approach to future projects because it makes large jobs easier to handle. 



*How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I used the debugger and also the simulator. These two revealed errors that needed fixing.



*Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The layout process was especially difficult because I had never done that process before. I required help with this portion.



*In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think I did particularly well in adding a component where users can add their weight and the date of the weigh-in.
